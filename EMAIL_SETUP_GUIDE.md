# Email Configuration Setup Guide

## âœ… Contact Form Email Setup

Your contact forms are now properly configured and ready to send emails! Here's what you need to do to activate email functionality:

### 1. Get a Resend API Key

1. **Sign up for Resend**: Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com) and create a free account
2. **Verify your domain**: Add your domain `thekpsgroup.com` to Resend (or use their subdomain for testing)
3. **Get your API key**: Copy your API key from the Resend dashboard

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with your actual values:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Resend API key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here

# Replace with the email where you want to receive form submissions
LEAD_TO_EMAIL=sales@thekpsgroup.com

# Optional: Google Tag Manager ID
GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX
```

### 3. Test Your Forms

Your site has two contact form implementations:

1. **Simple Contact Form** (`/contact` page) - Uses `/api/contact` endpoint
2. **Enhanced Multi-Step Form** (`EnhancedContactForm.astro` component) - Uses `/api/contact` endpoint

Both forms now:
- âœ… Save leads to your CRM database
- âœ… Send formatted email notifications to you

- âœ… Include comprehensive lead information and next steps
- âœ… Handle errors gracefully
